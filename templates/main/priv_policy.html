            <p>

                    Be wary of those who try to ask money from you for whatever reason. But it would be safer to cut off the communication. Remember a genuine person will not ask you for money in any circumstance. If someone asks you for money, use common sense and never give in to such requests.

                    Take all the time you need to decide on a trustworthy person and pay careful attention along the way. Be responsible
                    about romance, and don't fall for the oldest con tricks of people who shower love and affection at the first instance
                    and disappear later. Don't become prematurely close to someone, even if that intimacy only occurs online.
